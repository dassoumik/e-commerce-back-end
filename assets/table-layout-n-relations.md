    * References the `Product` model's `id`.

  * `tag_id`

    * Integer.

### Associations

Executed following association methods on Sequelize models to create the relationships between them:

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.
